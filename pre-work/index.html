            My name is Michael Moonan, I am from New Jersey and I am currently a student at Stevens Institute of Technology pursuing my passion in computer science.
            I thoroughly enjoy solving problems and am constantly seeking to learn new things about the field, and everything and anything about computers strikes a certain nerve in my brain. 
            (I probably played too many video games for my own good as a kid). 
            But that takes me into the origin of my GitHub name, my tag for any and every game I played or account I made was 'DaMoonMan' so when I went to sign up for GitHub I was flabbergasted when met with the dreaded: <b style="color: red;">"damoonman" is taken</b>
            So, i settled with Damoonguy.
            also if you are from Jersey it's pork roll <i>not</i> taylor ham
